# Blockchain-Smart-Contracts

This project aims to develop a management and analysis system for treatment stations, using technologies like smart contracts, artificial intelligence, and web interfaces. The system allows interaction with various functionalities, including voting, property registration, project delay prediction, resource allocation, IoT sensor monitoring, and service exchange among users.

## üî® Project Features

- **Voting System**: Allows users to vote for candidates, including listing and counting votes.
- **Property Registration**: Users can register properties and view registered properties.
- **Delay Prediction**: A system that uses AI to predict delays in construction projects based on historical data.
- **Resource Allocation**: Forecasts the resource needs for construction projects, automating allocation with smart contracts.
- **IoT Sensor Monitoring**: Uses sensors to monitor soil and weather conditions, recording data on a blockchain.
- **Service Exchange**: A system that allows users to exchange services with each other, recording transactions on the blockchain.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Techniques and Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: Programming language for developing smart contracts on Ethereum.
- **JavaScript**: Language used for frontend logic.
- **HTML/CSS**: Structure and styling of the frontend.
- **Python**: Used for data analysis and predictive modeling with AI.
- **Web3.js**: Library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Ganache**: For developing and testing smart contracts.
